### Team member: Chi Kuan Lai, Yifei Chen <br>

### Options
[Task 4](https://llmunlearningsemeval2025.github.io/) Machine Unlearning <br>
[Task 9](https://food-hazard-detection-semeval-2025.github.io/) Food Detection <br>

We will start with the Task 4 as we find this the most interesting. Yet if we reached unsolvable bottleneck, we will change to task 9.
